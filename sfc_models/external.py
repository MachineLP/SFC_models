    All currency values are expressed relative to this numÃ©raire (that is,
    the value of NUMERAIRE=1 by definition). In practice,
    at least one real currency will always have a value of 1.0 as well.

    It would probably be a bad idea to define another Country`s currency as NUMERAIRE;
    the assumption within the code is that the ExternalSector lives within its own
    CurrencyZone.

    Since it is assumed that the supply of each real currency is netted out to
    zero, we should never get 'NUMERAIRE' financial assets created. If this happens,
    the equation set up is incorrect. The framework allows such an incoherent state;
    it is up to the user to tune their equations to keep the net NUMERAIRE financial
    assets at zero. (A sanity check may later be imposed.)

    A Model can only have one ExternalSector; the object registers itself as the
    Model.ExternalSector when created.
