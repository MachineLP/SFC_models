TODO List
=========

**Major modelling functionality**

- Add prices to markets. (Currently only "dollar" volumes.)
- Add the idea of planned demand and supply, which can differ from realised demand and supply.
- Adaptive expectation support.
- Subdivide financial assets (*F*) into different financial assets.
- Exporter and importer sectors.
- Central banks and interest rates.
- Variable naming convention.
- Standard macro aggregates automatically added in.
- Can we eliminate machine-generated solver safely (and efficiently)?
- More equation reduction techniques.
- Alternative solution methods, if iterative scheme does not converge.
- Graphical interface?

**Module Setup**

- Cleaner handling of examples. (Installation to local directories.)
- Clean up the use of Sphinx for module documentation.
- Pypi installation clean up.
- Source/Github installation documentation.
- Sphinx-generated HTML documentation on the web.
- Github wiki.
- Examples in Pycharm Edu.
- More detailed analysis of model configuration to aid trouble-shooting.

**Documentation**

- User high level documentation.
- Better documentation of class methods.
- Hide "internal" methods?
- Doctests if possible, and more documentation in unit tests.
